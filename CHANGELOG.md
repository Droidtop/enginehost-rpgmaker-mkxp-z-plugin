All notable changes to this plugin are documented in this file. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Runs RPG Maker XP/VX/VXAce (RGSS) games through mkxp-z, proven on
  hardware with a real pad against MGQ Paradox 3.06 (testing channel,
  2026-09-27).
- Signed bundle releases on unstable and testing, verified file by file
  against this repository's pinned key at install time; a
  `PLATFORMS_DISPATCH_TOKEN` push tells the plugins index about a new
  release within a minute instead of waiting for its six-hourly schedule.

### Changed

- Moved signing into Enginehost's pinned `sign-engine-bundle.yml` job
  instead of running the signing script beside the build: the previous
  android job held the signing key while it ran `get_deps.sh` downloads,
  the native and Gradle builds, and third-party actions pulled by a
  moving tag, any of which could have taken the key.
